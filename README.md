# cpu-scheduling-py
This repository holds the extra code developed for partial fulfillment of online credit course "CS 370 - Operating Systems" (Non-degree) offered by Colorado State University Online for Spring 2024. Kindly note that this code was not submitted for grading. This version was intended to develop the design and logic of the algorithm (like a prototype).

## Info to heed
The CPU scheduler does not use high-level programming language like Python due to practicality. Hence this project is rather useful for user-level process or task scheduling. The dataframes were used for quick development process and not for the purpose of efficient programmming.

The actual submission of the homework is in C++ using the object-oriented design and functional logic developed in this version. But still uploading here since it was a worthwhile learning experience.

### To setup the environment:

```setup 
./env-setup.sh
```

### To run the code on any system:

```run 
python main.py in/CS370-HW-Input.csv
```
